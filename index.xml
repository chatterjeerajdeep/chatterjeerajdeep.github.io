      <description>Question 1 Generate a fair coin from a biased one If there is a biased coin, it means that the probability of H and T are not equal. Let&amp;rsquo;s say that the probability for H is p. That of T would be q = (1-p).
If we flip the biased coin 2 times, then following are the possibilities and their corresponding probabilities:
        P(HH) = p2   P(HT) = pq   P(TH) = qp   P(TT) = q2    We notice that the P(HT) and P(TH) are same.</description>

      <description>How to Lie with Statistics is a book by Darell Huff. First published in 1954, this book presents a very easy-going approach to rationally interpret and question the numbers that are advertised everywhere. With plenty of real-life examples, the author highlights how the marketing campaigns use some statistical statements to influence the mass, without any solid grounds to justify the same.
I find it often hard to relate technical terms used in regular text books, to real-life scenerios.</description>

      <description>The Problem Statement  You are about to get on a plane to Seattle. You want to know if you should bring an umbrella.
You call 3 random friends of yours who live there and ask each independently if it’s raining. Each of your friends has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of messing with you by lying. All 3 friends tell you that “Yes” it is raining.</description>
