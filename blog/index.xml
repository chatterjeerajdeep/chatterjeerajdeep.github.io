      <description>How to Lie with Statistics is a book by Darell Huff. First published in 1954, this book presents a very easy-going approach to rationally interpret and question the numbers that are advertised everywhere. With plenty of real-life examples, the author highlights how the marketing campaigns use some statistical statements to influence the mass, without any solid grounds to justify the same.
I find it often hard to relate technical terms used in regular text books, to real-life scenerios.</description>

      <description>The Problem Statement  You are about to get on a plane to Seattle. You want to know if you should bring an umbrella.
You call 3 random friends of yours who live there and ask each independently if it’s raining. Each of your friends has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of messing with you by lying. All 3 friends tell you that “Yes” it is raining.</description>
